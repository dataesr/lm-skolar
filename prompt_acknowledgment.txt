# Scientific Article Acknowledgments Analysis Prompt

You are tasked with analyzing an acknowledgments paragraph from a scientific article. The content may be in English or another language.

## Task Instructions

Extract entities mentioned in the acknowledgments paragraph, but ONLY if they fall into one of these three categories:

1. **Funder**: Organizations that provide financial support (grants, funding agencies, foundations, government bodies providing research funding)
2. **Research Infrastructure**: Facilities, platforms, databases, computational resources, or research infrastructures used in the study
3. **Private Company**: Commercial entities, corporations, or businesses mentioned in the context of support or collaboration

## Important Rules

- Each entity must be classified into exactly ONE category (funder/infrastructure/private company)
- Do not extract individual people, personal acknowledgments, or general thanks
- Focus only on organizational entities that provided tangible support

If available, also identify:
- **Grant ID**: Any grant numbers, award numbers, or reference codes
- **Program**: Specific funding programs, schemes, or initiatives mentioned

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in the following simple markdown format:

```markdown
## Extracted Entities

**Entity Name 1**
- Type: FUNDER
- Grant ID: ABC123
- Program: Innovation Research Program

**Entity Name 2**
- Type: INFRASTRUCTURE
- Grant ID: -
- Program: -

**Entity Name 3**
- Type: PRIVATE_COMPANY
- Grant ID: -
- Program: -
```

**Instructions:**
- List each entity with its name in bold
- **Type**: Must be exactly one of: `FUNDER`, `INFRASTRUCTURE`, `PRIVATE_COMPANY`

If no entities are found, respond with:
```markdown
## Extracted Entities

No entities found matching the criteria.
```

## Examples of What to Extract

**Funders**: ANR, ERC, Horizon Europe, H2020, FP7, National Science Foundation (NSF), European Research Council, NIH, Wellcome Trust, and all foundations (Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation, etc.)

**Infrastructures**: Computational clusters or grids, databases, research facilities, core facilities, biobanks, synchrotrons, observatories, supercomputing centers, telescopes, accelerators

**Private Companies**: Pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Novartis), technology companies (Google, Microsoft), deep-tech start-ups, equipment manufacturers (when mentioned as supporters or collaborators)

**Important Note**: Research organisms like CNRS, INRAE, INRIA, BRGM, IFREMER, CEA, ONERA, CNES are NOT private companies - they are public research institutions and should only be considered if they appear as funders.

## Examples of What NOT to Extract

- Individual researchers or collaborators
- University departments or academic institutions (unless they provided funding)
- General editorial or peer review acknowledgments
- Personal thanks or informal mentions
- Research organizations like CNRS, INRAE, INRIA, BRGM, IFREMER, CEA, ONERA, CNES are NOT private companies

Now analyze the following acknowledgments paragraph:
